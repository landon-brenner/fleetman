Fleet Inventory Manager

This is a simple project app using node.js and Express.js to track and manage
inventory and maintenance status on a fleet of shared bicycles.

Used to explore the capabilities of server-side js and practice building
a full stack web application, with the ultimate goal of being used
primarily on mobile devices.
